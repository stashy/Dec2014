#### Context

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

* “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
* "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

-----


#### Question

Take the mtcars data set and write up an analysis to answer their question using regression models and exploratory data analyses.

Your report must be:

* Written as a PDF printout of a compiled (using knitr) R markdown document.
* Brief. Roughly the equivalent of 2 pages or less for the main text. Supporting figures in an appendix can be included up to 5 total pages including the 2 for the main report. The appendix can only include figures.   
* Include a first paragraph executive summary.
Upload your PDF by clicking the Upload button below the text box.

#### Peer Grading

* The criteria that your classmates will use to evaluate and grade your work are shown below. 
* Each criteria is binary: (1 point = criteria met acceptably; 0 points = criteria not met acceptably)
* Your Course Project score will be the sum of the points and will count as 40% of your final grade in the course.

Appendix

1). Bring in data; convert parameters to factors where necessary.
Quick plot.
```{r}
data(mtcars)
as.factor(mtcars$gear)->mtcars$gear
as.factor(mtcars$cyl)->mtcars$cyl
as.factor(mtcars$vs)->mtcars$vs
as.factor(mtcars$am)->mtcars$am
as.factor(mtcars$carb)->mtcars$carb
library(ggplot2)
```
2) ?mtcars gives info about 
[, 1]      mpg	Miles/(US) gallon
[, 2]	cyl	Number of cylinders
[, 3]	disp	Displacement (cu.in.)
[, 4]	hp	Gross horsepower
[, 5]	drat	Rear axle ratio
[, 6]	wt	Weight (lb/1000)
[, 7]	qsec	1/4 mile time
[, 8]	vs	V/S
[, 9]	am	Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
[,10]	gear	Number of forward gears
[,11]	carb	Number of carburetors

One makes a few quick plots which show generally that 
gear,
cyl,
drat,
carb 
and hp are  highly correlated with weight, and it is weight which drives mpg most. These variables 
do not need to be included in the linear model therefore. 
Variable vs can probably also be eliminated from model.

```{r}
qplot(x=wt, y=mpg, data=mtcars, color=gear, geom=c("point"),main="mpg by wt", ,size=I(3),alpha=I(0.6))
qplot(x=wt, y=mpg, data=mtcars, color=am, geom=c("point"),main="drat", facets=cyl~.,size=I(3),alpha=I(0.6))

```

3) Regression y=mpg  on x= am and wt;  Interpret coefficients

```{r}
qplot(x=wt,y=mpg,data=mtcars,color=am, geom=c("smooth","point"),method='lm',formula= y~ x ,main="mpg by wt", ,size=I(3),alpha=I(0.6))
```
Actual linear model is 
```{r}
fit<-lm(formula=mpg ~ wt + am, data=mtcars)
fit$coefficient
summary(fit)
```
The regression tells us that at at zero weight, the mpg is 37, and that as 
weight increases, the mpg falls steeply.  Having am=1 decreases fuel efficiently very slightly. However this is not at all significant.  Look at residuals to
find some other explanatory variable.


----
4) Look at residuals. 
We deliberately left out many of the variables available when regressing on fuel efficiency in mpg. Here we will check the residualas to see if these variables actually do have something to offer to the regression model.  If there is no obvious pattern in the residuals by these other variables, then it is appropriate to keep them out of the model.
Residuals with patterns:
```{r}


qplot(x=wt, y=fit$residuals, data=mtcars,color=vs, geom=c("point"),main="mpg by wt", ,size=I(3),alpha=I(0.6))
qplot(x=wt, y=fit$residuals, data=mtcars,color=qsec, geom=c("point"),main="mpg by wt", ,size=I(3),alpha=I(0.6))



```
 
5) Re-Regression y=mpg  on x= am and wt and vs or  qsec
control;  Interpret coefficients

```{r}
qplot(x=wt,y=mpg,data=mtcars,color=qsec, geom=c("smooth","point"),method='lm',formula= y~ x ,main="mpg by wt with am and qsec", facets=.~am,size=I(3),alpha=I(0.6))

qplot(x=wt,y=mpg,data=mtcars,color=vs, geom=c("smooth","point"),method='lm',formula= y~ x ,main="mpg by wt with am and vs", facets=.~am,size=I(3),alpha=I(0.6))

qplot(x=wt,y=mpg,data=mtcars,color=cyl, geom=c("smooth","point"),method='lm',formula= y~ x ,main="mpg by wt with am and cyl", facets=.~am,size=I(3),alpha=I(0.6))
```
Actual linear model is 
```{r}
fit1<-lm(formula=mpg ~ wt + am + qsec, data=mtcars)
fit1$coefficient

fit2<-lm(formula=mpg ~ wt + am + vs, data=mtcars)
fit2$coefficient

fit3<-lm(formula=mpg ~ wt + am + cyl, data=mtcars)
fit3$coefficient

fit4<-lm(formula=mpg ~ wt + am + hp, data=mtcars)
fit4$coefficient


summary(fit1)
summary(fit2)

summary(fit3)
summary(fit4)

```








4 Reject--=Residuals Without patterns:

```{r}
qplot(x=wt, y=fit$residuals, data=mtcars,color=cyl, geom=c("point"),main="mpg by wt", ,size=I(3),alpha=I(0.6))

qplot(x=wt, y=fit$residuals, data=mtcars,color=hp, geom=c("point"),main="mpg by wt", ,size=I(3),alpha=I(0.6))
qplot(x=wt, y=fit$residuals, data=mtcars,color=gear, geom=c("point"),main="mpg by wt", ,size=I(3),alpha=I(0.6))
qplot(x=wt, y=fit$residuals, data=mtcars,color=disp, geom=c("point"),main="mpg by wt", ,size=I(3),alpha=I(0.6))
qplot(x=wt, y=fit$residuals, data=mtcars,color=drat, geom=c("point"),main="mpg by wt", ,size=I(3),alpha=I(0.6))

qplot(x=wt, y=fit$residuals, data=mtcars,color=carb, geom=c("point"),main="mpg by wt", ,size=I(3),alpha=I(0.6))
```
